# Healthify.AI

### An automatic trained voice-enabled conversational chatbot with images and video support which does not allow you to feel absense of doctor, hosptial staff and management by solving your desired quests.

## Abstract

Given the fact that every person is unique, some medical conditions are atypical and that bots canâ€™t communicate effectively (at least not yet), the answer for now is no. However, with rise of Artificial Intelligence and Chat-Bots probelms can be solved to a huge extent which will save patients and practitioners time and money while allowing a greater level of oversight.

#### Why Chat-Bots are more important in Health Care Industry?

* **Chat Bots can easily replace the work of Hospital Receptionist by guiding patients about hospital and its services(including billings,insurance coverage).**
* **Shortage of doctors**
* **Wasting time and money for small follow-ups**
